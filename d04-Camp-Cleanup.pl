=head3 Day 4: Camp Cleanup

=encoding utf8

Sundays are traditionally hard but it's early days and this was
suspiciously easy. Maybe people would try to expand the quite
complicated condition in part 1 to part 2 instead of looking at the
obvious solution which was to find the ranges that I<didn't> overlap
and subtract those from the total.
